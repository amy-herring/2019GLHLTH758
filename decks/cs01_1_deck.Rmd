## Birthweight

Birthweight is a commonly-used indicator of a newborn infant's health status. Because this indicator is easily obtained, it is a critical component of population health reporting by the World Health Organization and governments around the globe. The distribution of birthweight has often been described as approximately normal, though the left tail in particular is inflated relative to that from a Gaussian distribution.

## Variability in birthweight

Much of the variability in birthweight is explained by gestational age at delivery. A baby typically spends around 38 weeks in the uterus, but the average length of gestation is counted at 40 weeks. Pregnancy is counted from the last day of a woman's menstrual period (which is easily measured), but the date of conception is typically around two weeks later.

## Case Study Data

You will visualize data on birthweight and gestational age at delivery for babies born in North Carolina from 2011-2016. Relevant variables include the following.

- Birthweight in g (primary outcome variable)
- Gestational age in weeks (babies should gain weight until delivery)
- Biological sex assigned at birth (boys are heavier on average)

## Case Study Data

- Parity, or the woman's number of births including this one (on average, a woman's later babies are expected to weigh more than the first due to incomplete reversion of physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy to facilitate fetal growth, thus creating a more efficient system for later pregnancies)
- Plurality (singleton births usually weigh more than twins or higher-order multiples). Note that including multiple births to a mother (whether at one time or over a period of years) is a violation of any assumption of independence of observations.


## Case Study Data

- Maternal smoking (smoking is associated with lower birthweight; pregnant women are encouraged to quit smoking)
- Maternal age (be sure to explore nonlinear trends, as very young mothers and older mothers are often at higher risk)
- Maternal race (health disparities in birth weight have been identified in the literature, though mechanisms are largely unknown)
- Hispanic origin of mother
- Year of birth (useful to determine if there are any time trends)
- County of residence (very rough proxy for socio-economic status)

## Goals

- visualizing factors in relation to birthweight

- visually characterizing the relationship between each factor and birthweight
