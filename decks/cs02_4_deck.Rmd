## Pneumococcus data from contingency tables I BIOS 600 data
- talk about small samples, 0 cells
- talk about simple to understand because you want to know how rare -- well you can count all the possibilities and tell exactly!
- also talk about power -- Fisher's exact test does not buy you power, it buys you a test that is valid
- then show the 2015 NC infant mortality data and ask them about rates -- what do you show for these counties?  Assign 3 counties to 3 groups and ask them what to do!
