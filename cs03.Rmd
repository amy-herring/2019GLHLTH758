# Learning Objectives

- identify situations in which the generalized linear model (GLM) should be used for analysis 
- fit and interpret results of GLM's for binary and count data
- understand shrinkage and when hierarchical models may be useful in estimation
- fit, interpret, and illustrate results from hierarchical models
