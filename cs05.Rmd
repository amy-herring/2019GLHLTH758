# Learning Objectives

- identify interesting hypotheses to evaluate in your own global health data
- gain experience selecting appropriate statistical methods and writing an analysis plan that directly addresses your hypotheses

# Case Study Goals

- analyze data and interpret findings of your own study in global health
- effectively communicate results of your analysis to your peers using compelling graphical displays and text



# Data 

You will supply your own data for this project. 


# Resources

- RDAC Statistical Analysis Plan Template (on Sakai)

# Reports 

- A 1-page proposal is due September 4 at the beginning of class. This proposal must include an enumeration of hypotheses that you will address. You must clearly describe the data source, the date by which you will have complete access to the required data, and relevant data use restrictions/permissions (including evidence of IRB approval if required).
- A statistical analysis plan is due at the beginning of class October 2. This report must clearly delineate planned analyses and graphical displays. Each student will present the planned analyses to the class either October 2 or October 4. The DGHI Research Data and Analysis Core template will be used.
- Presentations of individual case studies will occur in class November 13, 15, 20, and 22
- A 5 page (maximum) written report, along with accompanying graphics (maximum 1 Tableau dashboard and/or 3 page appendix of figures), is due at the beginning of class November 22
