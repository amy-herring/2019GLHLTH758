# Learning Objectives

- understand differences in inferences possible when using cross-sectional versus longitudinal data
- fit and interpret generalized linear mixed effects models for longitudinal data
- fit and interpret models fit using generalized estimating equations
- understand types of missing data, their potential consequences, and appropriate methods for handling missing data in a variety of settings


# Case Study Goals (coming soon)
