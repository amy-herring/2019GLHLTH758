# Learning Objectives

- understand fitting and interpretation of general linear models
- understand situations in which standard models and methods may be inappropriate
- define and identify "small sample" situations in a variety of contexts
- gain skills to select and apply a variety of small sample statistical methods for analysis
- gain skills to understand consequences of small samples at the design stage of a project


# Case Study Goals

- explore factors related to birth weight in NC

- characterize factors related to infant mortality in NC on a statewide level, including exploration of time trends 

- determine whether infant mortality in specific racial and ethnic groups is level, declining, or on the rise


# Data 

We'll use the North Carolina birth and infant death data on Sakai for this assignment.

# Reports 

- In an interim report, create a model to describe how factors available in the NC births file are related to birth weight of infants. Be sure to describe your model and modeling approach clearly and to present results in language suitable for publication in a scientific journal. Graphical displays are encouraged. The report is not to exceed 5 pages. Reproducible code should be uploaded along with the report.

- An interim reproducibility check will be carried out by another team (each team will be responsible for checking reproducibility of another team's results).

- In a final report, examine the factors related to statewide infant mortality rates (not including county of residence as a predictor) and evaluate whether there is evidence that these rates are changing over time in any specific groups. This report is also not to exceed 5 pages. Reproducible code should be uploaded along with the report.

- Final reproducibility will also be checked by another (different) team, so each team will be responsible for checking reproducibility of another team.

The case study grade will be based on both reports and the reproducibility checks.
