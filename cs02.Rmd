# Learning Objectives

- understand fitting and interpretation of general linear models
- understand situations in which standard models and methods may be inappropriate
- define and identify "small sample" situations in a variety of contexts
- gain skills to select and apply a variety of small sample statistical methods for analysis
- gain skills to understand consequences of small samples at the design stage of a project


# Case Study Goals

- explore factors related to birth weight in NC

- characterize factors related to infant mortality in NC on a statewide level, including exploration of time trends 

- determine whether infant mortality in specific racial and ethnic groups is level, declining, or on the rise


# Data 

We'll use the North Carolina birth and infant death data on Sakai for this assignment.
