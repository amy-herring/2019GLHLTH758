### Materials

You should have access to a laptop and bring it to every class, fully charged. Texts and readings will be assigned as needed. Required software packages include R/RStudio (free) and Tableau (free for students).


### Topics and Important Dates
GLHLTH 758 contains a mixture of lecture, lab, and combination sessions at the usual class times. Sessions marked "lab" will be taught by Kelly and involve hands-on analysis and/or consultation about case studies.

Note: this schedule is approximate and is likely to be modified as the course progresses. Readiness assessments will be given without advance notice. Assignments are due at the beginning of class unless otherwise specified.
